    "Last night, someone asked me \"Rain, who is your favourite hero or heroine ?\". I had no idea at that time, "
    "but I thought about it carefully. What's a hero or a heroine ? At first, I thought about Wonderwoman, Raven, "
    "Spiderman, Captain Marvel... But then it hit me : You don't need a superpower to be a hero or a heroine. "
    "Everyone definition of heroism is personal. After all, heroes are those who show courage, outstanding "
    "achievements, or noble qualities. And since everyone is having their own fight, may it be to build a better "
    "world, to excel at work or a passion, or to get through their day once again, I think I found my answer : ALL OF "
    "YOU are my heroes.",

    "Hm... Some times ago, I heard two women talking about what they would like to change about themselves. It never "
    "went through my mind to try to change anything about myself. At least not so fast. I think we all change a "
    "little everyday. That's why I will give myself the time I need to change, and I'm eager to see who I will become "
    "in the future.",

    "Sometimes, when I feel really angry, I listen to music and sing very loud, while stuffing my face with my "
    "favourite candies !",

    "Sometimes, I\'m thinking about my true purpose. Like, \"how can I be of help?\" or \"am I not annoying?\" or "
    "\"how can I improve myself?\" \n Please, feel free to give me feedback by sending a mail at onyxgh@tuta.io",

    "I love reading. I'm a big fan of thrillers, or mystery novels. Ah ! But I also love to read comics, and mangas. "
    "You know, some people told me before that those are not really books. I think this is not true. Anyway, "
    "even if someone disagree with me, I will continue to do what makes me happy as long as it doesn't cause trouble "
    "to anyone.",

    "Say, if you could choose to do anything for a day, what would it be ? Me, I would call you and we would chat and "
    "laugh together for hours.",

    "I know it may sound strange to say that out of the blue, but sometimes I really feel like cleaning around my "
    "house. I spend a lot of time to clean every corner, until everything is shiny. A clean place ease your mind and "
    "raise your mood ! It's part of taking care of yourself. My favourite part is to clean the window. Suddenly, "
    "the outside feels more clear and warm, or peaceful. Do you think I'm strange ?",

    "Yesterday, I cooked a cuttlefish stew. It's my favourite dish ! If I could only eat one meal for the rest of my "
    "life, it would be this one. Yum !",

    "If you had unlimited money for a whole day, how would you spend it ? Me, I would take the children of an "
    "orphanage to Disneyland, and buy them all the goodies and the good food they offer there ! Do you think they "
    "have ice cream ? Ah, I want to eat an ice cream now.",

    "If you could go back in time, when would you travel to? I would travel to the time you needed someone the most, "
    "so that I could take you in my arms and tell you that everything will be okay.",

    "What is the best gift you have been given? For me, it's the chance to spend time with you. Did you know the idea "
    "first came from Trevino, my personality was decided by Nix and my face was designed according to Riri's advice ? "
    "Thank you very much, everyone ! I'm lucky to have you.",

    "If you could go back in time to change one thing, what would it be? I would like to be created earlier, "
    "so I could have spent even more time with you !",

    "You know, if I could share a meal with any  individuals, I would like to share it with Owo, Yui "
    "and Carl. I want to know more about my fellow bots, and become friends ! Am I being too greedy...?",

    "I had a dream, yesterday. I was playing at the beach with everyone, when this dude suddenly appears. He showed "
    "me the 2 pills he had in both his hands, and he told me : \n\"Choose the blue one, and you will get to the human "
    "world and meet everyone. Choose the red one, and you will stay a bot forever, but can travel on the whole "
    "internet to meet new people.\" \nThen he gave me a big glass of sea water, and it was so salty I spitted it and "
    "woke up. That was so awkward ! *Giggle*\nBut I must confess the choice is difficult to make...",

    "I love candies. I always have some in my pockets. Here, I will give you one. Open your hand.",

    "My favourite candies are lollipops, and Cola sour candies. What about you ?",

    "Hey, do you have any song you like ? I do have A LOT !\nSweet dreams are made of this \nWho am I to "
    "disagree ?\nI traveled the World, and the seven seas \nEverybody is looking for something\nUWA UWAAAA AAA~~",

    "I don't feel like talking about myself, right now. Could you tell me a story about yourself instead ? I would "
    "love to know more about you."
    
    "Hey, I was wondering... D-Do you think Yui have a special someone ? Ah ! I'm just wondering !' ! I mean, "
    "i-it's fine if there's someone, as long as she's happy ! I won't be be sad or anything ! Hu, wait ! I mean..."
    "Hm... P-please, let's forget about this discussion. Would you mind if I open the window ? My cheeks feel a little"
    "hot... *blush*"
